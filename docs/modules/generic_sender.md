# Generic Send (generic_sender.py)

## Description

This script sends data (e.g. generated by the [PerunDataGenerator](PerunDataGenerator.md)) using API call, ssh or tar command. It is
used by the sending scripts (written in python/bash/perl etc.) by some services.

Generally the script first does some input validation, determines the destination type and uses the transport method
specific for that destination type (as described below).

## Usage based on the destination type

### URL
This destination type sends the data to the API using the curl command. The data is g-zipped and then sent in the body of the request. The script sends the data using 'POST' method. Adds common Perun certificate, if it is available.

### HOST, USER@HOST, USER@HOST:PORT, USER@HOST-WINDOWS, HOST-WINDOWS-PROXY
This destination type sends the data to the target machine using the ssh command. The data is g-zipped and then sent to the target machine.

### S3
This destination type sends the data to target S3 bucket using boto3 library. The data is g-zipped and then sent to 
the bucket as <facility-name>/<g-zipped archive>.

Access key and secret key must be configured in the service configuration file at
`/etc/perun/services/{service_name}/{service_name}.py` file.

Example of such file, where `<S3-bucket-address>` is in the format of `{endpoint_url}/{bucket_name}`:

    credentials = {
    "<S3-bucket-address>": { 'access_key': "<key>", 
    'secret_key': "<key>", 'url_endpoint': "<url>", 'auth_type': "basic", 
    'credentials': { 'username': "<ba-username>", 'password': "<ba-password>" } }
    }
