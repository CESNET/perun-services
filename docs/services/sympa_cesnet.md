### [GEN](../concepts/gen.md)

The data is generated by custom gen scrip which calls 
_getHashedHierarchicalData_ method in API. Script generates file for each 
mailing list (optionally supporting also language variants). Not valid VO 
members are skipped by default, but can be allowed by mailing list settings. 
Users can opt out from the mailing lists by default, but this can be 
prevented by mailing list settings.

Script is using member mail for email addresses. Having one mailing list across 
multiple VOs might result in unexpected results (e.g. when user has 
different email addresses in a different VOs).

### [SEND](../concepts/send.md)

The script uses [generic_sender.py](../modules/generic_sender.md) to archive 
and send data over the SSH.

### [SLAVE](../concepts/slave.md)

Unpacks received data and atomically moves each file representing mailing list to the 
_/var/spool/mailinglists_sympa/_ directory. Directory is created by script 
if not exists and ownership _root:sympa_ and umask _640_ are set.

Destination directory for mailing list data is shared with basic _sympa_ 
service. Do not use these two services on the same Facility with same 
Destination. Having both of them configured might result in overwriting mailing 
list members with different email addresses.
