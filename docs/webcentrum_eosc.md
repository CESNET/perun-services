The data is generated by the [generateMemberUsersDataInJson](PerunDataGenerator.md) method, not valid VO
members are filtered out.

It is then gzipped to _perun_data.tar.gz_ archive and sent to an API by a PUT request with 
BA credentials (if configured - see _get_auth_credentials_ method in the [send_lib](../send/send_lib.py)).
The generated JSON data is stored in the _webcentrum_eosc_ file.
No slave script is provided.
