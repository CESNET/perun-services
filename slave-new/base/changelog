perun-slave-base (3.1.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Use also the old path for {service}.d (pre, mid, post) scripts. Old path 
    is /opt/perun/bin/{service}.d/ and the new path is 
    /etc/perun/{service}.d/. Same files in both paths has higher priority from 
    old path (take these).
  * Info to stderr if old path with scrips is still used (there are some
    scripts)
