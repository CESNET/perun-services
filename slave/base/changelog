perun-slave-base (3.1.8) stable; urgency=low

  * Perform write check on default locking folder LOCK_DIR=/var/lock/.
    If not writable, fallback to /tmp location. This ensure compatibility
    across most systems.
  * Locks location can be customized in /etc/perunv3.conf by setting
    LOCK_DIR to custom value. If specified path is not writable, script
    ends with exit code 15.

perun-slave-base (3.1.7) stable; urgency=high

  * Add perl script sync.pl to the base package of perun slave scripts,
    because we need to sync just one file instead of whole filesystem and we
    can use perl core function for this purpose.
  * Reason: command "sync" does synchronization of all mounted file systems on
    machine and if some of them are network fs, it can freeze the server for
    really long time. Synchronization of specific files can prevent this
    situation.

perun-slave-base (3.1.4) stable; urgency=low

  * New function diff_mv_sync using sync before and after diff_mv itself, it

perun-slave-base (3.1.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Use also the old path for {service}.d (pre, mid, post) scripts. Old path
    is /opt/perun/bin/{service}.d/ and the new path is
    /etc/perun/{service}.d/. Same files in both paths has higher priority from
    old path (take these).
  * Info to stderr if old path with scrips is still used (there are some
    scripts)
