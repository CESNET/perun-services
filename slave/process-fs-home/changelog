perun-slave-process-fs-home (3.1.9) stable; urgency=high

  * main file with data was divided into two files - first with data to create
    home directories for users, second with data to set quotas for all defined
    volumes
  * both files are now processed separately so first are created homes for all
    users and then quotas are set for defined volumes. Mid hooks are processed
    only for the first part of creating homes.
  * some arguments as user login, home mount point, gid etc. were removed from
    quotas template in script and also in pre script
  * this version of service fs_home supports new quotas attributes in Perun,
    although format of data in the file is the same. To active it administrator 
    has to set attribute readyForNewQuotas on Facility to 'true'
  * Protocol version was increased, new format is not supported with older
    versions of protocol communication
  * IMPORTANT: pre|post scripts and mid hooks can be also affected by these 
    changes and administrator should check and modify their behavior before 
    updating to this version

perun-slave-process-fs-home (3.1.7) stable; urgency=medium

  * minimalize creating TMP directories only for not existing home directories
    to prevent of preserving such directories in the case of force killing of
    running slave script
  * mid hook was moved before the part of creating TMP directory so it can't
    be used for working with this directory now

perun-slave-process-fs-home (3.1.5) stable; urgency=high

  * When creating home from skeletal directory, there was a problem with wrong
    behavior of 'cp -r' command. When temporary directory was already created,
    it copied not only files from skel dir, but the whole skel dir to the new
    home directory. Now it creates new directory from the skel dir if such
    exists and also preserve all ACLs and links there.

perun-slave-process-fs-home (3.1.4) stable; urgency=medium

  * Use temporary directory to prepare new home, set correct permission and
    ownership and then move it to the right place atomically. The reason for
    this change is to overcome problems on distributed filesystems.
